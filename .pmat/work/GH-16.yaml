title: "Category-Level Success Tracking in Corpus Diff"
description: |
  Enhance corpus_diff.sh to show which specific categories changed
  status (failing → passing or passing → failing) after depyler fixes.

  ## Use Case
  When depyler fixes a feature (e.g., walrus_operator), we want to see:
  - Which categories now pass that previously failed
  - Which categories regressed (if any)
  - Net category improvement count

  ## Enhanced Output
  ```
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  CATEGORY CHANGES
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✅ NOW PASSING (3):
     - example_walrus_basic
     - example_pathlib_ops
     - example_lambda_simple

  ❌ REGRESSED (0):
     (none)

  Net: +3 categories
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ```

  ## Implementation
  - Add Python helper script to compare parquet category success
  - Call from corpus_diff.sh
  - Show specific category names that changed
