title: "Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Quarterly Review Process"
description: |
  Establish a quarterly review process where Senior Rust Engineers
  review a random 5% sample of the corpus for quality assurance.

  ## Book Reference (aprender)
  - **Book**: EXTREME TDD - The Aprender Guide
  - **Chapter**: The Toyota Way / Genchi Genbutsu (Go and See)
  - **Concept**: Human verification of automated outputs

  ## Rationale (from corpus-quality-review.md Section 6.3)
  Automated tests cannot catch all anti-patterns. Human review identifies:
  - Unnecessary `unsafe` blocks
  - Excessive cloning
  - Non-idiomatic patterns that compile but violate Rust conventions

  ## Implementation
  1. Create `make corpus-hitl-sample` to generate review sample
  2. Random 5% selection with stratified sampling by category
  3. Generate markdown review checklist
  4. Track review findings in `data/hitl_reviews/`
  5. Document review process in `docs/hitl-review-guide.md`

  ## Review Checklist
  - [ ] No unnecessary `unsafe` blocks
  - [ ] Minimal cloning (prefer borrowing)
  - [ ] Idiomatic error handling (Result/Option)
  - [ ] Appropriate use of iterators
  - [ ] No Python-isms (Arc<Mutex<>> overuse)

  ## CLI Usage
  ```bash
  make corpus-hitl-sample      # Generate 5% sample for review
  make corpus-hitl-report      # Summarize review findings
  ```

  ## Output Structure
  ```
  data/hitl_reviews/
    └── 2025-Q4-review.json
  docs/
    └── hitl-review-guide.md
