title: "Automated Fix Recommendations for Depyler"
description: |
  Analyze failures and generate prioritized recommendations for depyler team.

  ## Use Case
  After corpus analysis, generate actionable recommendations:
  - High-impact fixes (most files affected)
  - Pattern-based grouping (async, stdlib, etc.)
  - Estimated improvement per fix

  ## CLI Usage
  ```bash
  # Generate recommendations
  make corpus-recommendations

  # Show top 5 recommendations
  ./scripts/generate_recommendations.sh --top 5
  ```

  ## Output
  ```
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  DEPYLER FIX RECOMMENDATIONS
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Based on 143 failing files:

  1. [HIGH] async context managers (12 files)
     Pattern: async with / __aenter__ / __aexit__
     Impact: +2.0% success rate

  2. [HIGH] time.time() support (8 files)
     Pattern: time.time() call
     Impact: +1.3% success rate

  3. [MED] heapq operations (6 files)
     Pattern: heapq.heappush/heappop
     Impact: +1.0% success rate

  ```

  ## Implementation
  - Analyze failing categories and patterns
  - Group by root cause
  - Estimate impact based on file count
